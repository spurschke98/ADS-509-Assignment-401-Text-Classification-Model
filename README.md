## Naive Bayes Project

This project utilizes Naive Bayes for two main purposes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Building a Naive Bayes classifier to analyze convention speeches and predict political party affiliation (Republican or Democratic).
2. **Classification of Tweets**: Applying the classifier to categorize tweets from 2018 congressional candidates and comparing predictions with actual party affiliations.

### Data

Download the data from this [DropBox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mwhd2ktvtnyapwx/nb-assignment-data.zip?dl=0) and extract it into the same folder as this repository.

### Parts

**Part 1: Exploratory Naive Bayes**
- Build and fit a Naive Bayes classifier using speech text to predict party affiliation.
- Use provided code to manage feature selection and improve model performance.
- Fill in observations from the fitted model.

**Part 2: Classifying Tweets**
- Extract and prepare tweet data from the 2018 congressional database.
- Clean, tokenize, and create features for tweets.
- Apply the classifier from Part 1 to estimate the party of the tweeter and compare with actual party data.
