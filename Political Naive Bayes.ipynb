    "### My Observations\n",
    "One notable observation from the output is the significant imbalance between the number of words indicating a Republican speaker compared to those suggesting a Democratic speaker. Specifically, there are only two words, \"votes\" and \"climate,\" that strongly associate with Democratic speeches. This finding suggests that Republican speeches may exhibit more repetitiveness and a narrower range of topics, while Democratic speakers demonstrate greater linguistic diversity and cover a wider array of subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that the absence of words like \"welfare\" and \"Medicaid,\" which are often associated with Democrats, is surprising. However, this could indicate that the classifier has identified other distinguishing features or that the training data may not have adequately represented these specific terms.\n",
